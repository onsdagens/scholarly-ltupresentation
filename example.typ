Here is a code snippet with highlighting:\ ```Rust let b = if a != 0 {100/a} else {100}```

= Double column slide
#ltu-slide[
  - Demonstrate the ability to perform *model-based* design of *small footprint* (low-powered, low-memory) distributed embedded real-time systems
  - Modelling and analysis of real-time applications under the RTIC framework
][ // These two brackets need to be on the same line!
  - Power-profiling down to the micro-second/ampere
  - Validation of embedded software by debugging and tracing
