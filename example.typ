- on various indentation levels
  - such as two level nesting
    - or three levels of nesting
      - what about four?

= Course Aims and Content
Using `#pause` splits the content over multiple slides
#pause

This is appears separately\
Here is a code snippet with highlighting:\ ```Rust let b = if a != 0 {100/a} else {100}```

= Double column slide
#ltu-slide[
  - Demonstrate the ability to perform *model-based* design of *small footprint* (low-powered, low-memory) distributed embedded real-time systems
  - Modelling and analysis of real-time applications under the RTIC framework
  // These following two brackets need to be on the same line:
][
  - Power-profiling down to the micro-second/ampere
  - Validation of embedded software by debugging and tracing
]

= Manual double column slide
However, it is not yet known how or why this works. In case you want to use something that does not involve black magic you can do it manually for example like this:

#box(width: 1fr)[First column]
#box(width: 1fr)[Second Column]

#pagebreak()

= Bibliography
#bibliography(title: none, "ref.bib", style: "ieee")
